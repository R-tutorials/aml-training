\# RStudio Training Materials for tidymodels

These directories contain training materials that we've presented for the `tidymodels` packages. We keep this repo up-to-date with the most recent content.

They are organized by the length of training. The current set of materials:

* `two day`: from RStudio::conf 2020

* `one day`: 2019 Symposium on Data Science and Statistics (these are fairly out-of-date and don't include newer packages)

* `half day`: 2019 R/Pharma conference (these are fairly out-of-date and don't include newer packages)
