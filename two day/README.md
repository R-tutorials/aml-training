# "Applied Machine Learning" training notes

**Note**:

This repository will always contain the most recent version of these course notes. As the tidymodels infrastructure is being developed, we will update this repo to stay consistent with the current package versions. 

This repo contains the slides, code, and data for the workshop in the `Materials` directory.

To get started, see the `installs.R` file in the `Preparations` directory.
